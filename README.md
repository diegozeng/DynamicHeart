DynamicHeart
============
Version 1.0

Matlab m-file to build a dynamic heart. It is an open source code, welcome to use and modify it. I really hope that it 

will be helpful. Further improvement is in my planï¼Œ now it is just a simple one.

Background:

I used it as a small gift of Chinese Valentine's Day (2013.08.14) to my girlfriend, So when you decided to use it, pls 

don't forget to change its title and the text inside. Otherwise it may cause some misunderstood or something even worse,

I am irresponsible for this.

Setup:

This project just include a m-file

If you have a Matlab, you can just apply it by copy the code into m-file editor. Then you know what to do next.O(^_^)O

(In case: just copy the code, save it in some certain directories, then type "dynamic()" in your commandline.)

I tested the m-file in the matlab 7.0 environment, which means that if you have a newer version, it should be ok for you 

to apply it directly.(Those versions that below 7.0, I cannot guarantee it works well)
